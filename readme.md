Just a shell based on extionizer at the moment 

Goal is to block certain urls from ever showing in search results, 

for example: 
paid only medium sites 
other sites with paywall
block any ad results 
if a result returns only ads - no content - save it to a database (this happens pretty often would be interesting to see *how* often)


Todo -- Find out how to get the div that holds the search result container and remove/hide it
      -- Send the list of urls we *dont* want to see and remove/hide them from the page
